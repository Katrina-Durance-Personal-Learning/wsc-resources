*Write/Speak/Code is increasing the visibility and leadership of women and non-binary coders through thought leadership, conference speaking, open source contributions, career development and personal growth.  We offer conference and events as well as local meetups in New York, Chicago, and San Franscisco.*

*Our annual conference is focused on tangible skills and community support.  Attendees of the Foundations track will write a blog post, give a talk, and contribute to open source. Attendees of the Explorations track will explore new code, leadership, and self-care skills in action oriented talks and workshops. 2017 workshops included creating a technical zine and building an outline to gove a workshop.*

*In 2016, we added an Alumna track focused on Leadership and Self-Care with focused time and mentorship on a personal project. This has been transformed into the Explorations track.

*In 2016, we introduced a 4th day: Self-Care &amp; Career Day, focused on topics such as: balancing career and motherhood, salary negotiation, posture and physical health, and emotional labor.*
