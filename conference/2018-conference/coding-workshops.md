# Write/Speak/Code 2018 Sponsor Workshops


## Rapid Prototyping / Hackathon Skills - 11:10am - Microsoft

In this workshop, weâ€™ll build a Node.js web app using Express. We'll set up our development environment, build a feature using a third party API, and discuss ways to expand the project. You'll walk away with the confidence to get up and running on building your own personal project.  This is a sponsored workshop presented by [Squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com/).

## ElixirBridge: Building a web app in Elixir - 1:55pm - Microsoft
Elixir is a newer functional programming language that lends itself well to fault tolerant and highly concurrent applications. We'll learn about the power of asynchronous processes, functional programming, and massive parallel connections while building a web application in Elixir. We'll also gain a basic understanding of Elixir syntax, and get a feel for its idiosyncrasies. This is a sponsored workshop presented by [Carbon Five](https://www.carbonfive.com/).
