# Accessibility Resources - Draft

## CART
CART is live transcription. It can either be on a monitor for everyone to see (more A/V setup and needs) or an iPad for 1 individual.

## ASL
Often interpreters ask for information or to speak with the person who needs ASL. In particular, they want to know their level of hearing and relative age of onset.

We want to let people know that this will be a tech conference and that we prefer women/non-binary interpreters. 

They will likely ask for a copy of the slides and curriculum. We will provide a draft pdf as soon as possible.  

Notes:
* 2 interpreters are always required for anything over 1 hour
* If attendees are in different tracks then we will need a set of interpreters per attendee

## Childcare
*Note*: 
The reality is that often people request childcare and cancel at the last minute. Either the kid is ill or they found a family member to watch them.  Usually we just pay the caregiver for an hour or two and let them go home.
We are providing piece of mind and **ability for parents to RSVP** an event.  This is a particularly significant act of inclusion for single parents.  Sometimes that is all we provide even if we pay for the service.  


Information we need from parents for each child:
* name
* age
* allergies or dietary restrictions (especially nuts!)
* medication or health needs
* nap time if any

We ask that parents bring:
* food (meals, snacks, bottles etc)
* medications (including Epi pen or other emergency needs)
* toys / activities
* blanket or mat for naps if needed

Things to consider when hiring caregivers:

* Children younger than 2 or 3 will need at least 2 sitters if there are more than 1 child or the event is longer than an hour. (The sitter needs to be able to go to the bathroom and the child can't be left alone)
* Large age ranges in children will necessitate different sitters
* Young children and infants (under 5) must have a sitter that is experienced with children their age.  Infants (under 1) are a separate experience level.
* We should have at least 1 sitter per 2-3 children

**We should always provider sitters with meals**, i.e. lunch.

There are 3 options for childcare:

### 1. Supervised playarea
A supervised playarea is in the building where the event and parents are located. Legally, this is not "childcare," because parents are in the building

This is preferred for on-site events lasting a day or less.  Legally, it requires parents to be in the *same building*.

We usually post an ad using our SitterCity account.  You can copy and edit previous ads.  

Criteria for sitters:  
* If we need more than one and they are friends, that's a bonus
* Considerations based on child ages
* Experience with *groups of children*
* Experience creating activities
* Background checked

#### Logistics
* Assign someone to handle caregivers on the day of
* We usually pay the sitters in cash or paypal at the end of the conference.
* Meet the caregiver in the morning and show them to the room

### Full childcare provider
This is a fully insured and bonded childcare event service.  This is best for off-site childcare and
